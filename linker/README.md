# [GORMock] / Linker

The linker is required to connect the required types depending on the type of
application assembly.

## How it work?

During a normal build of application using `go build`, the linker appends the
standard package [GORM] but if you run tests with the addition of a flag
`-tags gormock` linker replace [GORM] on [GORMock] in the tests will have the
opportunity to use a mock instead original types of [GORM].

```Shell
# Using for run tests
go test -tags gormock
```

## How do I use it?
