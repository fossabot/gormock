The fantastic mock for the fantastic [GORM] library, aims to be developer
friendly.

## How it's work?

The package works on the basis of type substitution when compiling the
application. To use the **gormock** package, you need to replace the 
import `gorm.DB` on imports `linker.DB`, package **linker** implements change of
types that will allow to use **gormock** for testing. But for testing you will
need to use the build tag **gormock** to make the compiler understand what
types to use. In the end, the tests using **gormock** must be run with the
command `go test -tags gormock ./...`.

## How do I use it?
